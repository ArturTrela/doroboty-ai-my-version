# DoRoboty.ai — AIPH3 prototype

A frontend-only job marketplace for participants to extend and test. Built with React, TypeScript and Vite, using the existing DoRoboty.ai Graphical theme and Base UI components.

## Run

Requirements: **Node.js 24 and npm**.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3001. No environment file, account, database or additional service is required. Package installation requires access to the npm registry.

Select Anna or Marek as a candidate, Karolina or Tomasz as an employer, or the instructor. Publish a job, apply, switch person and record the employer decision. Changes survive reload in this browser; settings provide export, import and reset. AI and scores simulate prepared scenarios. Use example CVs only.

## Build and verify

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
./scripts/verify
```

The static output is dist/. Browser checks require an already provisioned Playwright Chromium; starting the app never installs it. See [participant guide](docs/PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md), [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [current features](FEATURES.md) and [case protocol](docs/case/CASE_PROTOCOL.md).

To distribute a baseline participant package, run npm run package:participant -- /absolute/output/directory. This excludes Git history and instructor source material. Never distribute this repository’s history as a stage-safe packet.
